A groundbreaking ceremony was held today for what developers are calling the most ambitious urban renewal project in the city's history.

The $500 million development will include:

- 300 residential units
- 50,000 square feet of retail space
- A public park and plaza
- Underground parking for 400 vehicles

## Community Response

Local residents have expressed mixed reactions to the project. Supporters cite the need for downtown revitalization, while critics worry about displacement and rising property values.

"This is exactly what our downtown needs," said Mayor Johnson at the ceremony. "It will bring jobs, housing, and new energy to an area that has been underutilized for decades."

## Timeline

Construction is expected to take three years, with the first phase—the residential tower—scheduled for completion in late 2028.

The development team has committed to including 50 affordable housing units as part of the agreement with the city.
